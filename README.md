# 🧩 3D Projects with React + Three.js

This repository contains experimental and production-ready 3D scenes built using:

- ⚛️ **React**
- 🎮 **Three.js**
- ⚡ **Vite** (lightning-fast bundler)
- 🧵 **@react-three/fiber** (React renderer for Three.js)
- 🎯 **@react-three/drei** (helper components for easier scene building)

These projects showcase 3D modeling, animations, lighting effects, and custom user interaction — perfect for learning and pushing creative web boundaries.

🚧 **WIP**: Constantly evolving as I experiment with ideas and effects.
